For PassPort   or Drivers licence read the process is triggered when and new contenct document is uploaded

trigger ContentDocumentTrigger on ContentDocument (after insert) {
    
    ID jobID = System.enqueueJob(new ScanAsync(trigger.new));
    }
    
    This would be a very bad way to do things in practice !!
